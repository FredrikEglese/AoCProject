# Advent of Code 2019 Solutions
My code for the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019). This was not completed with any looking at solutions or code examples.

For each day of challenges there are two parts. I have prioritised doing the first part of each day initially but naming convention allows for both parts. For day x, part one of the challenge is x_1.py and part two is therefore x_2.py.

For simplicity's sake, I have not included any of the task descriptions, just my solutions. To see what each script is solving in more detail, please check the [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/2019) webpage.

## Deployment

This code is written in Python3, using version 3.6.9.
