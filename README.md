# AoC Solver Website and Solutions

## Website

I have put together a Django application which solves advent of code problems. This was my first application written in Django, so was a good learning curve.

Any feedback on ways to improve the way that I have written this, please raise and issue, PR or message me.

## Solutions
My code for the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019). This was not completed with any looking at solutions or code examples.

For each day of challenges there are two parts. I have prioritised doing the first part of each day initially but naming convention allows for both parts. For day x, part one of the challenge is x_1.py and part two is therefore x_2.py.

For simplicity's sake, I have not included any of the task descriptions, just my solutions. To see what each script is solving in more detail, please check the [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/2019) webpage.

The solutions are written in Python3, using version 3.6.9.
